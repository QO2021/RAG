        "1.  Clone the repository or download the notebook file.\n",
        "2.  Open the notebook in Google Colab.\n",
        "3.  Obtain API keys for the Gemini API and Pinecone.\n",
        "4.  Store the API keys in Colab's Secrets Manager with the names `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_API_KEY`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The notebook includes a conceptual exploration of how RAG could be applied to oil price analysis. This involves using external data sources (financial news, reports, etc.) as a knowledge base to provide context and explanations for oil price movements observed in time series data. While the full RAG implementation for oil prices is conceptual due to data acquisition limitations, the notebook demonstrates the foundational RAG components with other datasets.\n",

        "## GitHub Integration\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook includes steps to push the notebook to a GitHub repository. Ensure you have a GitHub repository created and store your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) in Colab secrets as `GITHUB_PAT`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook serves as an introduction to applying RAG principles to data analysis tasks. While a full-scale implementation for oil price analysis requires significant data acquisition and processing, the conceptual framework and the working RAG examples on other datasets provide a solid understanding of how RAG can be used to augment traditional data analysis with external knowledge."
